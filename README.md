Hi, I'm Elia, and I'm a Computational chemist. In this repository, I'll store any project, program, or script I've done during my academic journey. The goal of this directory is to provide suggestions, help, and a free space to anyone who feels lost in the field of computational chemistry.
During my studies, I've always felt like I was missing something. I was an applied student and most of the time I preferred to sacrifice my free time to study and get good marks, and most the time I accomplished it. Despite the good grades, I kept feeling behind, as everyone was proceeding and I was stuck in the mud. Later, talking with colleagues and professors, I realized that it wasn't me, but everyone felt the same. And it wasn't my fault either, but the teaching system wasn't providing the right information for us to learn what requirements a computational chemist should fulfill. 
This repository won't replace your classes or any online courses provided by some IT guy, but rather will drive you through some of the commonest tasks in computational chemistry. About that, what is the most efficient way to explain something about coding? Most of the time, the answer is coding, so let's delve into this and let's see what we get.
